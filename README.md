# machine-learning-fundamentals
Hands-on machine learning exercises in Python using scikit-learn, including classification models, evaluation, and visualization.

## 📊 Project Overview

In this project, we work with the **Iris dataset**, a classic dataset used for classification tasks.  
The notebook covers the full machine learning workflow:

- Data loading and exploration  
- Train / test split  
- Feature scaling  
- Model training  
- Model evaluation  
- Data visualization  

---

## 🤖 Models Implemented

The following machine learning models were trained and evaluated:

- **Logistic Regression**
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**  
  - Tested with multiple values of *k*
- **Random Forest Classifier**

Each model is evaluated using accuracy and confusion matrices.

## 📈 Visualizations

The notebook includes several visualizations to better understand the data and model behavior:

- Class distribution
- Feature relationships (scatter plots)
- Confusion matrix heatmaps
- Feature importance from Random Forest
- Accuracy vs. *k* for KNN

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python  
- scikit-learn  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn
